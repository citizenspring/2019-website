Our goal is to build a platform to surface citizen initiatives in your city starting with Brussels and Antwerp. 

In these days of demonstrations for the climate, we need to show people that a different way to live in harmony with the environment and local communities is possible. There are already a lot of citizen initiatives around zero waste, local and circular economy, cooperatives, etc. They just need more visibility and more citizens to support them and contribute to their success.
